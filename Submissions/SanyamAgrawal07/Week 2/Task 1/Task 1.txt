The main difference between a proxy and a VPN is encryption. VPNs hide not only your private IP address but all your 
web activity, such as the websites you visit, using encryption. Proxy servers, on the other hand, will only change 
your IP address, but they wonâ€™t encrypt your online activities.

While proxy servers certainly have their purpose, VPNs are a much more comprehensive and effective way to stay private 
online.
