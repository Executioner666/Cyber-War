A VPN and a proxy are online services that hide your IP address by rerouting your internet traffic through a remote server. But a proxy works only with a single app or service, while a VPN secures all your internet traffic and encrypts it for extra security and privacy.



If you are after end-to-end encrypted traffic, a VPN is better for you. 
If you need IP masking and misdirection, a proxy is better suited.

Differences:

VPNs are generally slower than proxies because of their encryption process. 
This makes it unsuited for activities such as scraping, automation, or botting.


Some established proxy providers (e.g. Instantproxies, NewIPNow) offer private proxies at $1 each while VPNs can cost significantly more.
