you can enable Scroll Lock with this command:

xmodmap -e "add mod3 = Scroll_Lock"

Your Scroll Lock LED should now respond to Scroll Lock key presses.

To activate that modmap in my home directory.

Create a file called .Xmodmap in your home directory containing this line:

add mod3 = Scroll_Lock

//The easiest way to do that is:

cd ~
echo >.Xmodmap "add mod3 = Scroll_Lock"
