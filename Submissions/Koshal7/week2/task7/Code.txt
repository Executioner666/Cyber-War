We will be using Python's built-in zipfile module, 
And the third-party tqdm library for quickly printing progress bars:

pip3 install tqdm

We will use the big rockyou wordlist . On Kali Linux, you can find it under the /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz path.

Otherwise we can generate our own wordlist file also.

Open up a new Python file and follow along:

import zipfile
from tqdm import tqdm
# Let's specify our target zip file along with the word list path:
# the password list path you want to use, must be available in the current directory
wordlist = "rockyou.txt"
# the zip file you want to crack its password
zip_file = "SUV.zip"

# initialize the Zip File object
zip_file = zipfile.ZipFile(zip_file)
# count the number of words in this wordlist
n_words = len(list(open(wordlist, "rb")))
# print the total number of passwords
print("Total passwords to test:", n_words)

with open(wordlist, "rb") as wordlist:
    for word in tqdm(wordlist, total=n_words, unit="word"):
        try:
            zip_file.extractall(pwd=word.strip())
        except:
            continue
        else:
            print("[+] Password found:", word.decode().strip())
            exit(0)
print("[!] Password not found, try other wordlist.")
