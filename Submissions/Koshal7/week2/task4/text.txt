First, we create a password protected zip file.

we have an image of car named as car.jpeg.

we set the password as "pass123". 

Then we use zip2john zipfilename.zip > textfilename.txt
(we named the textfilename as passwd.txt here)

then john textfilename.txt

and we are able to see the password of the zip file.
