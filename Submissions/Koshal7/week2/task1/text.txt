This depends on what you need the proxy or VPN for.

If you are after end-to-end encrypted traffic, a VPN is better for you. 
If you need IP masking and misdirection, a proxy is better suited.

Although proxies and VPNs provide anonymity and act as an intermediary when connecting to the internet, they have major differences.

VPNs are generally slower than proxies because of their encryption process. 
This makes it unsuited for activities such as scraping, automation, or botting.

Proxies are also more affordable compared to VPN. 
Some established proxy providers (e.g. Instantproxies, NewIPNow) offer private proxies at $1 each while VPNs can cost significantly more.
