While VPNs and proxy servers both allow you to access the web from a different location, a VPN is much more secure than a proxy server.
Where proxies only secure your web browser, VPNs secure and encrypt your entire online network. That’s because a VPN encapsulates your internet connection, 
while a proxy only covers the specific site you’re visiting.

Unlike VPNs, which come preconfigured, proxies also require configuration for each application and service you use (think email, sites, streaming services, 
etc).Therefore, proxy servers need more manual work upfront while providing a less-than-stellar performance, while most VPN apps require little-to-no 
customization after they’re installed. 

Moreover, VPNs offer more location options to choose from, not to mention most dedicated VPN services provide apps for virtually every device under the sun. 
And while it’s worth making the distinction between free proxies and paid ones, neither are as useful as a VPN.
