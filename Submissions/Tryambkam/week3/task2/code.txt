After downloading and installing Wireshark, you can launch it and double-click the name of a network interface under Capture to start capturing packets
 on that interface. For example, if you want to capture traffic on your wireless network, click your wireless interface. You can configure advanced 
features by clicking Capture > Options, but this isn’t necessary for now.



As soon as you click the interface’s name, you’ll see the packets start to appear in real time. Wireshark captures each packet sent to or from your system.

If you have promiscuous mode enabled—it’s enabled by default—you’ll also see all the other packets on the network instead of only packets addressed to 
your network adapter. To check if promiscuous mode is enabled, click Capture > Options and verify the “Enable promiscuous mode on all interfaces”
 checkbox is activated at the bottom of this window.



Click the red “Stop” button near the top left corner of the window when you want to stop capturing traffic
